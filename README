This script is made mainly for my YukiNeko firmware, so some files may be missing from yours.

A Rockchip update.img could be unpacked with the tool imgrepackerrk.

The system image should be mounted at /system mount point (as it is the most convenient for me).

Create this mount point:

sudo mkdir /system

Mount your image when in its directory:

sudo mount system.img /system

better to leave mount without any options, it will auto-probe the image and mount it correctly.

In the script directory there should be a system folder. Files, obviously, are copied from there.

Run it as root:
sudo sh zip2system.sh
